# Visual Interface for World Bank Data 
## Group 29: Jessica S., Jessica L., Olena O.,  Cameron A.

## Purpose
The following document details the requirements for *Visual Interface for World Bank Data*. This system allows a registered user to log in and explore a variety of data from the World Bank, perform several kinds of analysis and visualize both the original data and the output of the analysis via graphs, charts, histograms, etc. This document presents models at the business scenario and domain level. It also addresses the non-functional requirements of the system such as the allocation of tasks between the developers and the foreseeable project schedule.
## Overview
The aim of this project is to implement a user-friendly visual interface and several robust data analysis strategies that allow the user to access and analyze health, education, and environment data from the World Bank. This project will be implemented in Java and will use code and guiding materials supplied by CS2212B instructor.
 
The system Visual Interface for World Bank Data requires several Database files that store user-input validating data sets. It also requires a functional API to retrieve data from World Bank.  

This project strives to implement the ideas and guidelines of modern software development process by applying SCRUM-like model and functional programming paradigms.

## Project README note
## New note from Jess [03/29/2021]
I have created a dev branch where we will commit and push our code/work to. This will allow us organize our final product better and avoid confusion. Whenever one of us needs to build a new feature or bugfix, they will create a new branch based off the dev branch. After adding the necessary features or changes, they will then merge their branch back to dev.

When creating a new branch, use naming conventions such as `feature/...` for a new feature or if you are updating an existing feature, and `bugfix/...` to fix a bug.

### Example:
``` 
master
+-------------------------------------------------------
 \                    / <- merge from dev to master   /
  \__________________/_______________________________/
   dev â”Œ> \______/ <- merge from feature/starting-point to dev
       |   e.g. feature/starting-point
       |
       pull from dev to create feature/starting-point
```
